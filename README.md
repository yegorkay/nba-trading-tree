currently this only works if we have trades involving:

- two teams
- one player for many players

it should work for:

- multi-team
- many players for many players

try to implement soon:

- showing the correct tradedFrom and tradedTo values if more than 1 player is traded to another team
- i.e. Kawhi + 2 other player for George Hill
